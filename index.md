# Welcome to plantFEM

You can download the [plantFEM](https://github.com/kazulagi/plantfem.git) to perform physical simulation for plants.

[Japanese](index_ja.md)

# Get started!

## (1) Let's download plantFEM into your local system:

```shellscript

git clone https://github.com/kazulagi/plantfem.git && cd plantfem && python3 setup.py

```

## (2) or you can run on Google Colab

```
!git clone https://github.com/kazulagi/plantfem.git 
%cd ./plantfem
!python3 setup.py
```

## (3) Also, docker is available


```
docker pull kazulagi/plantfem
docker run --rm -it kazulagi/plantfem /bin/bash
```

Then, let's install plantFEM.


```shellscript 

./plantfem install

```

In case of Google Colab, please add ``!`` before a command. For instance, a command ``./plantfem install`` is

```shellscript 

!./plantfem install

```



When you install plantFEM, you'll also get build and execution tools for Fortran since plantFEM is based on the modern Fortran. The plantFEM does lots of things:


- create your new project with ``./plantfem new``
- build & run your project with ``./plantfem run``
- update your plantFEM ``./plantfem update``
- check mannual with  ``./plantfem man``
- set hostfile for MPI with  ``./plantfem hostfile``
- change cpu-core for MPI with  ``./plantfem cpu-core``


You can write a script on ``server.f90`` in your root directory of plantFEM. If you want to use other modules written in Fortran, please set them into ``addon/`` directory. All Fortran files in the directory is compiled with the plantFEM library before they are linked to your ``server.f90`` script.


Further, you can easily use MPI by following steps.

- set your hostfile at ``etc/hostfile``
- write number of cpu-cores in ``etc/cpucore`` or run ``./plantfem cpu-core`` before running your script.

## Examples

### 3D objects

(Experimental)


[3D objects](3dsample.html)

### Scripts and coding
plantFEM consists of 4 components, each of which contains some libraries for numerical simulations. All examples runs when it is copied and pasted into ``server.f90`` and executed by ``./plantfem run`` command.

### std

A standard library of Fortran prepared for plantFEM. This module extends fortran for easier use. 

Try it on from HERE >> [std](Tutorial_std.md)

### fem

A library for data-objects for FEM analysis.

Try it on from HERE >> [fem](Tutorial_fem.md)

### sim


A library for simulators for FEM analysis.

Try it on from HERE >> [sim](Tutorial_sim.md)

### obj

A library for realistic objects such as soybean, stem, leaf, soil, air, light ...etc.

Try it on from HERE >> [obj](Tutorial_obj.md)
